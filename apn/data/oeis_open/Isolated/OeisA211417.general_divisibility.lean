# Integrality and supercongruences of the factorial ratio $\frac{(6n)! n!}{(3n)! (2n)!^2}$

Integral factorial ratio sequence:
$$a(n) = \frac{(30n)! n!}{(15n)! (10n)! (6n)!}$$

The product term in the denominator of the general conjecture:
$$\prod_{i = 1..r, i \text{ coprime to } 30} (30n - i)$$
We define this in ℤ to handle the $n=0$ case where $30n-i$ in the product might be negative.

Conjecture: "More generally, for r >= 1, we conjecture that there exists a constant D(r) such that
D(r)*a(n)/Product_{i = 1..r, i coprime to 30} (30*n - i) is integral for all n."
- _Peter Bala_, Aug 28 2025

This generalizes `thirty_mul_sub_one_dvd_a` (the $r = 1$ case where $D(1) = 1$).
