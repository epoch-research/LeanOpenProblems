The blow-up of the 5-cycle $C_5$: replace each vertex of $C_5$ with an independent set of $n$
vertices, and connect two vertices iff their corresponding vertices in $C_5$ are adjacent.
The vertex set is $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \times \{0, \ldots, n-1\}$, where $(i, a)$ and $(j, b)$
are adjacent iff $j = i + 1$ or $i = j + 1$ in $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$.

Can every triangle-free graph on $5n$ vertices be made bipartite by deleting at most $n^2$ edges?

theorem erdos_23 : 
    ∀ (n : ℕ) (V : Type) [Fintype V], Fintype.card V = 5 * n →
      ∀ (G : SimpleGraph V), G.CliqueFree 3 →
        ∃ (H : SimpleGraph V),
          H ≤ G ∧ H.IsBipartite ∧ (G.edgeFinset \ H.edgeFinset).card ≤ n^2 := by
