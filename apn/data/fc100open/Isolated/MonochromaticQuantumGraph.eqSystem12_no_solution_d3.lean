# Monochromatic quantum graphs (inherited vertex colorings)

This file studies the existence of *monochromatic quantum graphs*: edge-coloured, edge-weighted
complete graphs whose perfect matchings induce vertex colourings, with the property that

- every **non-monochromatic** inherited vertex colouring has total weight `0`, while
- each of the `D` **monochromatic** colourings has total weight `1`.

In the quantum-optics motivation, such a construction corresponds to generating high-dimensional
multipartite GHZ-type states using probabilistic pair sources and linear optics (without additional
resources), where interference patterns can be expressed as weighted sums over perfect matchings.

## Main questions (informal)

- For `N = 4` and `D ≥ 4`, does there exist such a graph/weighting?
- For even `N ≥ 6` and `D ≥ 3`, does there exist such a graph/weighting?

## Formalisation sketch

A quantum graph with `N` vertices and `D` colours can be encoded by a weight function
`W : EdgeN N D α → α` (for a coefficient domain `α`).

For each assignment of vertex indices `ι : V N → Fin D`, we define a perfect-matching sum
`pmSumN N D W ι` (a sum over perfect matchings, where each matching contributes the product of the
corresponding edge weights determined by `ι`). The equation system `EqSystemN N D W` requires

`pmSumN N D W ι = 1` iff `ι` is constant (all entries equal), and `0` otherwise.

The open conjectures in this file ask for non-existence/existence of such `W` over various
coefficient domains (e.g. `ℂ`, `ℝ`, `ℤ`, and restricted integer weights).

## `allEqual`: "all indices are equal"

We package the property "all indices `ι v` are equal" as a chain condition along a vertex list.

Concretely, `allEqualList ι L` means that the relation `ι v = ι w` holds between adjacent elements
of `L`. We implement this with `List.IsChain`, which is convenient for later reasoning and provides
good simp/decidability support.

## Perfect matching sum, general `N`

Fix a semiring `α`, a weight function `W : WeightsN N D α`, and an index assignment
`ι : V N → Fin D`. The next definitions compute the sum over perfect matchings of the complete graph
on `N` vertices, where each edge is selected with the endpoint indices given by `ι`.

We define an auxiliary function `pmSumListAux W ι n L` with a decreasing fuel parameter `n`
(used only for termination). In the intended use, we call it with `n = L.length`.

Intuition (when `n = L.length`):

* `n = 0` : the empty matching contributes `1` (empty product).
* `n = 1` : odd number of vertices, so no perfect matchings; value `0`.
* `n = n' + 2` and `L = v :: vs`:
  pair `v` with each `u ∈ vs`, multiply the edge weight by the recursive contribution on the
  remaining vertices `vs.erase u`, and sum over `u`.
-/

/-- Auxiliary perfect-matching sum on a vertex list, using a fuel parameter `n` for termination.

When called as `pmSumListAux W ι L.length L`, this computes the weighted sum over all perfect
matchings on the vertices in `L`. The recursion pairs the head vertex with each later vertex and
recurses on the remaining vertices.

For lists of odd length, there are no perfect matchings and the value is `0`. -/

# Witnesses & theorems (sanity checks)

These proofs use `native_decide` over `ℕ` to verify the equation system computationally.
For witnesses that use only `0` and `1`, the result transfers to any semiring `α` since the
computation tree is identical. For the `ℂ` case, the proof uses `fin_cases` + `norm_num`.

We state the same family of "no-solution" conjectures for multiple coefficient domains:

* `ℂ` (complex)
* `ℝ` (real)

All "general" conjectures are restricted to even `N`.
