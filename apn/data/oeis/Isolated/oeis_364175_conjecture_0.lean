A364175: $a(n) = \frac{(6n)! (2n/3)!}{(3n)! (2n)! (5n/3)!}$.
The fractional factorial $x!$ is defined as $\Gamma(x+1)$.
This sequence is only conjecturally an integer sequence. We round the real-valued result to obtain a natural number.

Conjecture: the supercongruences $a(n p^r) \equiv a(n p^{r-1}) \pmod{p^{3r}}$
hold for all primes $p \ge 5$ and all positive integers $n$ and $r$.
Note: The expression $r-1$ is a natural number subtraction, which is safe since $r$ is positive.
