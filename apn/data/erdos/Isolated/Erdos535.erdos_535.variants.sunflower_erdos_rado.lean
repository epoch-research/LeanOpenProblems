All elements of `A` are positive and have exactly `k` prime factors,
counted with multiplicity.

Erdős [Er73] explains that Abbott pointed out the ordinary sunflower conjecture
does not seem to suffice for Problem 535; the corrected stronger auxiliary
statement uses $Ω$, not $ω$.

For the stronger $Ω(n)=k$ variant above, the Erdős–Rado method gives the weaker
bound $c_r^k \cdot k!$; see Erdős [Er73].
