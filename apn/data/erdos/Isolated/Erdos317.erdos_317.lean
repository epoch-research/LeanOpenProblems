Is there some constant $c>0$ such that for every $n\geq 1$ there exists some $\delta_k\in \{-1,0,1\}$ for $1\leq k\leq n$ with
$$0< \left\lvert \sum_{1\leq k\leq n}\frac{\delta_k}{k}\right\rvert < \frac{c}{2^n}?$$

theorem erdos_317 : 
    ∃ c > 0, ∀ n ≥ 1, ∃ δ : Fin n → ℚ,
      Set.range δ ⊆ {-1, 0, 1} ∧
      letI lhs : ℝ := |∑ k, (δ k) / (k + 1)|
      0 < lhs ∧ lhs < c / 2^n := by
