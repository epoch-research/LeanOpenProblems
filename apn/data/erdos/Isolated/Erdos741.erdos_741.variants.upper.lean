Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be such that $A+A$ has positive upper density.
Can one always decompose $A=A_1\sqcup A_2$ such that $A_1+A_1$ and $A_2+A_2$
both have positive upper density?

theorem erdos_741.variants.upper : ∀ A : Set ℕ, 0 < upperDensity (A + A) → ∃ A₁ A₂,
    A = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∧ Disjoint A₁ A₂ ∧ 0 < upperDensity (A₁ + A₁)
    ∧ 0 < upperDensity (A₂ + A₂) := by
