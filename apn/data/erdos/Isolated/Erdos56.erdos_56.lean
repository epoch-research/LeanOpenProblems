Say a set of natural numbers is `k`-weakly divisible if any `k+1` elements
of `A` are not relatively prime.

    ∀ s ∈ A.powersetCard (k + 1), ¬ Set.Pairwise s Nat.Coprime

`MaxWeaklyDivisible N k` is the size of the largest k-weakly divisible subset of `{1,..., N}`

/--
`FirstPrimesMultiples N k` is the set of numbers in `{1,..., N}` that are
a multiple of one of the first `k` primes.

noncomputable def FirstPrimesMultiples (N k : ℕ) : Finset ℕ :=
    (Finset.Icc 1 N).filter fun i => ∃ j < k, (j.nth Nat.Prime ∣ i)

/--
Suppose $A \subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$ is such that there are no $k+1$ elements of $A$ which are
relatively prime. An example is the set of all multiples of the first $k$ primes.
Is this the largest such set?  To avoid trivial counterexamples, we must insist that $N$ be at
least the $k$th prime.
