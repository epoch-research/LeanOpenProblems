/-- The predicate that `A` is monotone, `A 0 = n` and for all `j`, `A (j + 1)` is the smallest natural number that
cannot be written as a sum of consecutive terms of `A 0, ..., A j` -/

/-- Let $a_1< a_2 < ⋯ $ be an infinite sequence of integers such that $a_1=1$ and $a_{i+1}$ is the
least integer which is not a sum of consecutive earlier $a_j$s. Show that $a_k / k ^ {1 + c} \to 0$
for any $c > 0$. -/
