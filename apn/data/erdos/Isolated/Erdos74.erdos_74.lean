bipartite by deleting `k` edges.

For a graph `G` and a number `n`, this is the set of `minEdgeDistToBipartite A` for all
induced subgraphs `A` of `G` on `n` vertices.

def SimpleGraph.subgraphEdgeDistsToBipartite (G : SimpleGraph V) (n : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  { (SimpleGraph.minEdgeDistToBipartite A) |
    (A : Subgraph G) (_ : A.verts.ncard = n) (_ : A.verts.Finite) }

/--
For a given graph $G$ and size $n$, this defines the smallest number $k$
such that any subgraph of $G$ on $n$ vertices can be made bipartite by deleting
at most $k$ edges.

This value is optimal because it is the maximum of `minEdgeDistToBipartite` taken
over all $n$-vertex subgraphs. This means there exists at least one $n$-vertex
subgraph that requires exactly this many edge deletions.
This is Definition 3.1 in [EHS82].

/--
Let $f(n)\to \infty$ possibly very slowly.
Is there a graph of infinite chromatic number such that every finite subgraph on $n$
vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most $f(n)$ edges?
