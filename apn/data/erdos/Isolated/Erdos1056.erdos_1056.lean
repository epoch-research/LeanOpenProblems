/--
The proposition that the modular product of a collection of consecutive interval equals $1$ modulo $p$,
where intervals are defined by a function specifying the consecutive boundaries.

  ∀ i : Fin k,
    (∏ n ∈ Finset.Ico (boundaries i.castSucc) (boundaries (i.castSucc + 1)), n) ≡ 1 [MOD p]

/--
Let $k ≥ 2$. Does there exist a prime $p$ and consecutive intervals $I_0,\dots,I_k$
such that $\prod\limits_{n{\in}I_i}n \equiv 1 \mod n$ for all $1 \le i \le k$?
