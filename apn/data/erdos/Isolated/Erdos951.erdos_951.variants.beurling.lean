/-- A sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` is said to have property `Erdos951Prop` if for any pair of distinct
finitely supported sequences `k l : ℕ →₀ ℕ` their corresponding Beurling integers are of distance
at least one apart. -/
def Erdos951Prop (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (k ℓ : ℕ →₀ ℕ), k ≠ ℓ → |beurlingInteger a k - beurlingInteger a ℓ| ≥ 1

/-- Beurling conjectured that if the number of Beurling integer in `[1, x]`
is `x + o(log x)`, then `a` must be the sequence of primes. -/
