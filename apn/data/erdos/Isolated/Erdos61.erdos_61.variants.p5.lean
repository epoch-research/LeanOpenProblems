For a graph $H$, consider all graphs $G$ that do not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph.
We would like to find a lower bound $f(n)$ such that every such $G$ on $n$ vertices
has a clique or independent set of size $\ge f(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$.

Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour [NSS23] proved the conjecture for $H = P_5$, the path on five
vertices: every $P_5$-free graph on $n$ vertices has a clique or independent set of
polynomial size.
