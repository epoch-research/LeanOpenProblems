- [jarfo/min-modulus](https://github.com/jarfo/min-modulus), the author's Lean development of
  the paper's Main Theorem. Section 7 of the paper describes it.

The paper's Main Theorem fixes the super-increasing set $\{2^k - 1\}$ and pins the least modulus
at which *it* is valid. Conjecture 1 says no other set of $n$ residues does better, and is open.

**Conjecture 1 (Fonollosa, 2026).** For every $n \geq 2$ and every
$N < 2^n - 2^{\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor}$, no set of $n$ residues mod $N$ is valid.

Equivalently the super-increasing set $\{2^k - 1 : 0 \leq k \leq n-1\}$ attains the least
valid modulus, which is `minModulus n`.

`0 < N` excludes `N = 0`, where `ZMod 0` is `ℤ` rather than a finite modulus and `{1, 2}` is
valid, which would make the statement false for a reason unrelated to the question.
